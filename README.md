# Coro-Nah
With places starting to reopen after lockdown, it can be difficult regaining people’s trust to visit restaurants/theaters/gyms etc. Much of this is for good reason, as customers cannot be certain which locations are following proper guidelines to mitigate the spread of COVID-19, and which are not.

Our software solution will allow people to determine which places are safe to visit and which are not based on the experiences of others. This should boost people’s trust in businesses following safe practices, and help those businesses as a result while reducing the ongoing spread of COVID-19, potentially drastically.

## Inspiration
With places starting to reopen after lockdown, it can be difficult regaining people’s trust to visit restaurants/theaters/gyms etc. Much of this is for good reason, as customers cannot be certain which locations are following proper guidelines to mitigate the spread of COVID-19, and which are not. Additionally, our team was interested by Google Maps Platform and Google Cloud, and we wanted to address the API Challenge, while also being eligible for the opportunities presented by the COVID-19 hackathon fund.
## What it does
Our software solution allows users to determine which places are safe to visit and which are not based on the experiences of others. By offering a rating system to a wide base of users, the application will progressively get better at letting people know which places are following proper guidelines. This should boost people’s trust in businesses following safe practices, and help those businesses as a result while reducing the ongoing spread of COVID-19, potentially drastically.
## How we built it
We built our application using Python/Flask for the backend and HTML/CSS, with some use of Bootstrap for the frontend. We also used both the Google Maps and the Google Places APIs.
## Challenges We ran into
This was our first hackathon and all of us were unfamiliar with building a web app in Python, however we each played to our strengths and rapidly learned new skills to develop a product we were happy with. We ran into some issues connecting the database to the rest of our application, but by working as a team we were able to resolve the issues.
## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
Our search bar is very useful and an integral component of the app. Additionally, we have a map display for every place a user can select, and we were able to break down health safety guidelines into 3 primary categories, each of which carries its own rating before being aggregated into the total.
## What I learned
How to work with a team in a fast-paced environment to develop a software product we are all enthusiastic about. Also, how to utilize Google Cloud Platform
and the Google Places API.
## What's next for Coro-Nah
We can't wait to add more features and functionality to our application. We would like to extend the program to work in any Zip Code and also add autocomplete to our search bar to make it even easier to use. We would also like to make further UI improvements, possibly including displaying the ratings in a more engaging, color-coded manner. In the future, we also believe a mobile application would be useful, even though our web app can be accessed from mobile.
