With places starting to reopen after lockdown, it can be difficult regaining people’s trust to visit restaurants/theaters/gyms etc. Much of this is for good reason, as customers cannot be certain which locations are following proper guidelines to mitigate the spread of COVID-19, and which are not.

Our software solution will allow people to determine which places are safe to visit and which are not based on the experiences of others. This should boost people’s trust in businesses following safe practices, and help those businesses as a result while reducing the ongoing spread of COVID-19, potentially drastically.
